     <h3> 
        Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class 2017($20,787 - $43,990)
        
 </h3>
    <p>
        The 2017 Mercedes-Benz GLC is a five-passenger compact crossover SUV available in GLC300 and all-wheel-drive GLC300 4Matic trims. There's also the high-performance AMG GLC 43, which offers extra power and a few more options as standard equipment. There's also the new-for-2017 GLC-Class Coupe, with a sleeker roofline and more sporting look. For more about the GLC Coupe,<a href="https://www.edmunds.com/mercedes-benz/glc-class-coupe/">check out our review</a> .

Standard features for the GLC300 include 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED daytime running lights, adaptive suspension damping (not driver selectable), keyless remote entry and ignition, a power liftgate, power-folding mirrors, automatic wipers and roof rails. Standard advanced safety features include forward collision warning and mitigation, a drowsy driver warning system and a crosswind assistance system.

Additional standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, adjustable drive settings, synthetic leather upholstery (MB-Tex), a 14-way power driver seat with memory functions, 40/20/40-split power-folding rear seats, a universal garage door opener, a rearview camera, a 7-inch infotainment display, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, Mbrace Connect (includes smartphone app integration) and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player, HD radio and two USB ports.

The optional Premium 1 package adds blind-spot monitoring, advanced keyless entry, a household-style 115-volt power outlet and satellite radio. The Premium 2 package includes all of the Premium 1 features, plus a navigation system with voice control, an 8.4-inch display and real-time traffic and weather information. It also adds a touchpad controller, cargo net and a collapsible crate in the cargo area. The Premium 3 package adds adaptive LED headlights with automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, active lane keeping assist, forward collision mitigation with pedestrian detection, active blind-spot assistance, and an air freshener and purification system.

The Sport package includes sporty body styling, 19-inch wheels, upgraded brakes and stitched MB-Tex dash trim. The Night package includes the Sport package equipment but with gloss black exterior accents and black wheels. The Active Parking Assist package adds front and rear parking sensors, an automated parking system, hands-free liftgate activation and a surround-view camera.

Other available options include 20-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension, panoramic sunroof, a roof spoiler, an illuminated Mercedes grille star, a head-up display, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, rear side-window sunshades, a Wi-Fi hot spot, a 14-speaker premium Burmester surround sound system and internet streaming radio. Several Mercedes Mbrace options are also available, including emergency telematics and concierge services.

The AMG GLC 43 model includes 4Matic, a sport-tuned air suspension, 20-inch wheels  and a powerful V6 engine. It also comes standard with the Premium 1 package and unique exterior and interior design flourishes to help set it apart.

Powering the GLC300 models is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 241 hp and 273 pound-feet of torque. A nine-speed automatic transmission sends power to the rear wheels or all four wheels in the case of the 4Matic model.

In Edmunds testing, a rear-wheel-drive GLC300 accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 6.2 seconds, which is quick for vehicles in this class equipped with the base engine.

The  <a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=37845&id=37853">EMG estimates</a> fuel economy at 24 mpg combined (22 city/28 highway) from the GLC300 and 24 mpg combined (21 city/28 highway) for the 4Matic. These numbers are quite good for the compact luxury crossover segment.

The AMG GLC 43 uses a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 that produces 362 hp and 384 lb-ft of torque. A nine-speed automatic transmission and 4Matic all-wheel drive come standard.

      <h3>
        Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class 2018($22,996 - $48,890)

</h3>
<p>

    The 2018 Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class is a small luxury crossover SUV with seating for five. It's offered in four trim levels. Most buyers will select the four-cylinder GLC 300 since it's the most affordable and can be ordered with a wide range of luxury and safety enhancements. There's also the GLC 350e plug-in hybrid (late availability) that pairs the four-cylinder with an electric motor. Performance enthusiasts will enjoy the AMG GLC 43's turbocharged V6, while the AMG GLC 63 (also late availability) turns up the wick even more with a turbocharged V8. 

Note that though the GLC 300 comes with standard rear-wheel drive and offers all-wheel drive (called 4Matic) as an option, the rest of the lineup comes with all-wheel drive. The GLC 350e uses a seven-speed automatic transmission, and the other models use a nine-speed auto.

The base GLC 300 comes equipped with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (241 horsepower, 273 pound-feet of torque), 18-inch wheels, adaptive suspension damping (not driver selectable), a power liftgate, a rearview camera, power-folding mirrors (with auto-dimming on the driver side) and automatic wipers. Inside, you'll find dual-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a power-adjustable steering wheel, adjustable drive settings, a power-adjustable driver seat with memory functions, 40/20/40-split power-folding rear seats, simulated leather upholstery (MB-Tex) and keyless ignition.

Tech features include a 7-inch infotainment display, Mbrace Connect (includes smartphone app integration), and an eight-speaker sound system with HD radio and two USB ports.

Select the GLC 350e plug-in hybrid and an electric motor and battery pack will be paired to the four-cylinder for a combined 315 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque. Its EV-only range and standard equipment have not been made public, but the features and options should be similar to what's offered in the GLC 300.

The AMG GLC 43 is quite different from the above two trims. In addition to a potent turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (362 hp, 384 lb-ft), the GLC 43 is further equipped with 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned air suspension, a sport steering wheel, the contents of the GLC 300's Premium package (blind-spot monitoring, keyless ignition and entry, satellite radio and a 115-volt power outlet), simulated-suede seat inserts and heated front seats.

The most exciting trim is the AMG GLC 63. Besides its turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 (469 hp, 479 lb-ft), you also get upgraded brakes, LED headlights, a mechanical limited-slip differential, variable torque distribution for the all-wheel drive system, and a 14-speaker premium Burmester surround-sound system.

Some features on the upper trims can be ordered on lower trims, though most extras are grouped into packages that are available across the GLC lineup. Safety-minded buyers might consider the Driver Assistance package, which adds adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and mitigation, rear cross-traffic alert, and forward collision warning and mitigation (with automatic braking). It also adds the contents of the Premium package to the GLC 300.

There's also the Advanced Parking Assist package. It includes a top-down parking camera system, front and rear parking sensors, an automated parking system and a hands-free liftgate. For the ultimate night cruiser, check out the Advanced Lighting package, which adds adaptive LED headlights, automatic high-beam control, interior ambient lighting and illuminated door sills.

For the techies out there, a Multimedia package is offered, with a navigation system, touchpad controller and an 8.4-inch central display screen. There's also an option that bundles Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but note that it's incompatible with the Multimedia or Driver Assistance package.

Some of the features in the above packages can be ordered as stand-alone options. There are a number of separate items that buyers might also want to add. Styling upgrades include 21-inch wheels, the Night package (glossy black exterior elements) and the AMG Line (GLC 300 only, adds interior and exterior appearance modifications, a flat-bottom steering wheel and the GLC 43's upgraded brakes).

Luxury enhancements are also available, such as a cabin fragrance and air purification system, a panoramic sunroof, a head-up display, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, rear side-window shades, various trim accents and multiple premium leather upholsteries (paired with adjustable passenger thigh support and memory settings). A performance exhaust system is available exclusively for AMG models.

    Tech features include a 7-inch infotainment display, Mbrace Connect (which includes smartphone app integration), two USB ports, and an eight-speaker sound system with HD radio and a media player interface. On the safety front, you also get forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and a driver attention monitor.
    
    Select the GLC 350e plug-in hybrid, and an electric motor and battery pack will be paired to the four-cylinder for a combined 320 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque. 4Matic AWD is standard. Electric-only range is estimated to be just 10 miles, however. After that, the 350e is rated at 25 mpg combined. A fuel miser, it's not. Otherwise, it's similarly equipped to the GLC 300.
    
    The AMG GLC 43 is quite different from the above two trims. In addition to a potent turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (362 hp, 384 lb-ft), the GLC 43 is further equipped with 20-inch wheels, a sport-tuned air suspension, upgraded brakes, a sport steering wheel, the contents of the GLC 300's Premium package (blind-spot monitoring, keyless ignition and entry, and satellite radio), simulated-suede seat inserts, and dash and door trim finished in MB-Tex.
    
    The most exciting trim is the AMG GLC 63. Besides its turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 (469 hp, 479 lb-ft), you also get further upgraded brakes, LED headlights, a mechanical limited-slip differential, variable torque distribution for the all-wheel-drive system, and a 14-speaker premium Burmester surround-sound system.
    
    Some features on the upper trims can be ordered on lower trims, though most extras are grouped into packages that are available across the GLC lineup. We would recommend that buyers strongly consider the Driver Assistance package, which adds adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and front and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking. It also adds the contents of the Premium package to the GLC 300. Not only are they worthwhile safety benefits, but they are better executed than most.
    
    There's also the Advanced Parking Assist package. It includes a surround-view parking camera system, front and rear parking sensors, an automated parking system and a hands-free liftgate. For the ultimate night cruiser, check out the Exterior Lighting package, which adds adaptive LED headlights and automatic high-beam control. The Off-Road Engineering package (GLC 300 4Matic only) includes multiple off-road vehicle settings, hill descent control, an underbody guard, and a special off-roading setting for the headlights when the Exterior Lighting package is also selected.
    
    For the techies out there, a Multimedia package is offered with a navigation system, touchpad controller and an 8.4-inch central display screen. There's also an option that bundles Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but note that it's incompatible with the Multimedia or Driver Assistance package.
    
    Some features in the above packages can be ordered as stand-alone options. There are a number of separate items that buyers might also want to add. Styling upgrades include 21-inch wheels; the Night package, which brings glossy-black exterior elements; and the AMG Line, which is available for GLC 300 only and adds interior and exterior appearance modifications, a flat-bottom steering wheel and the GLC 43's upgraded brakes.
    
    Luxury enhancements are also available, such as tri-zone climate control, a cabin fragrance and air purification system, a panoramic sunroof, a head-up display, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, rear side-window shades, various trim accents, and multiple premium leather upholsteries (paired with adjustable passenger thigh support and memory settings). A performance exhaust system is available exclusively for AMG models.

    <h3>Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class 2020($26,999 - $57,898)</h3>
    <p>
        The 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLC is a five-passenger compact SUV available in four trim levels. The four-cylinder GLC 300 is the most affordable and can be ordered with a variety of luxury and safety enhancements. Performance enthusiasts will enjoy the AMG GLC 43's turbocharged V6, while the AMG GLC 63 turns up the wick even more with a turbocharged V8.

        On the other end of the efficiency spectrum, the GLC 350e plug-in hybrid (available mid-2020) pairs the four-cylinder engine with an electric motor.
        
        The base GLC 300 is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (255 horsepower, 273 lb-ft of torque) paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. All-wheel drive (Mercedes calls it 4Matic) is optional.
        
        The GLC 300 comes with a well-rounded list of standard features, highlighted by LED headlights, a power liftgate, and power-adjustable and heated front seats. The MBUX infotainment system is anchored by a 10.25-inch touchscreen and also includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. Standard safety features include blind-spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking, and a drowsy driver warning system.
        
        The GLC 350e plug-in hybrid is similarly equipped. It uses the same transmission and four-cylinder engine, but it adds an electric motor for 315 total system horsepower. It's available only with all-wheel drive.
        
        The AMG GLC 43 also has a similar set of features compared to the GLC 300 but comes with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 (385 hp, 384 lb-ft) and all-wheel drive. It also adds a few extra special features such as a sport-tuned air suspension and a performance-enhanced transmission and exhaust.
        
        The most exciting trim is the AMG GLC 63. Besides its turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 (469 hp, 479 lb-ft), it also comes with upgraded brakes, a mechanical limited-slip differential, variable torque distribution for the all-wheel-drive system, and a premium Burmester surround-sound system.
        
        The GLC also offers a variety of options and packages, everything from additional driver assistance features, a self-parking system, upgraded leather upholstery, and enhanced technology and infotainment features. As you might expect, adding options can cause the price to skyrocket, but it's easy to tailor the GLC to your tastes.

    <p>

        The 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLC is a five-passenger small luxury SUV offered in three trim levels: GLC 300, GLC 300 4Matic and AMG GLC 43. The model numbers correlate to different engines or outputs but otherwise come with similar standard and optional features. Highlights include:

        GLC 300
        A well-rounded base model with:
        
        Turbocharged four-cylinder engine (255 horsepower, 273 lb-ft of torque)
        Nine-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive
        LED headlights
        Power liftgate
        18-inch wheels
        Power-folding side mirrors
        Keyless entry and push-start ignition
        Simulated leather upholstery
        Power-adjustable and heated front seats
        Driver's seat memory settings
        Dual-zone climate control
        Household-style power outlet
        10.25-inch touchscreen display with Mercedes' MBUX interface
        Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration
        Standard advanced driver aids features include:
        
        Forward collision mitigation (warns if a front impact is imminent and applies the brakes if you don't respond in time)
        Blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert (warns you if a vehicle is in your blind spot during a lane change or while in reverse)
        Automated parking system (steers into a parking spot with little or no driver intervention)
        Automatic high beams
        GLC 300 4Matic
        The GLC 300 4Matic has the same features as above but with all-wheel drive.
        
        AMG GLC 43
        A sportier version of the GLC, the AMG 43 comes with:
        
        Turbocharged V6 engine (385 hp, 384 lb-ft)
        Sport-tuned all-wheel drive
        20-inch wheels
        Sport-tuned air suspension (adapts to improve ride comfort and handling)
        Customizable ambient cabin lighting
        Upgraded interior trim
        The GLC offers abundant options, both as stand-alone selections or bundled in packages. Nearly all are available on all four trim levels if they're not already standard. Highlights include:
        
        Driver Assistance package
        Adaptive cruise control (maintains a driver-set distance between the GLC and the car in front)
        Lane keeping assist (steers the GLC back into its lane if it begins to drift over the lane marker)
        Lane keeping system (makes minor steering corrections to help keep the vehicle centered in its lane)
        Enhanced blind-spot monitoring (can steer the GLC to help avoid a collision with a vehicle in your blind spot)
        Enhanced collision avoidance braking
        Lane change assist (can initiate and execute a lane charge automatically after activating the turn signal for a certain length of time)
        Panoramic sunroof
        360-degree camera system (gives you a top-down view of the GLC and its surroundings for tight parking situations)
        Leather or upgraded leather upholstery
        Ventilated front seats
        Heated rear seats
        Heated steering wheel
        Tri-zone climate control
