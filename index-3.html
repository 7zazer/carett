The Baby Benz grew up four years ago when the C-Class replaced the 190E. The new car was substantially improved over the 190, offering better performance and more interior room. This year Mercedes' best-selling models should appeal to Americans even more because of more powerful engines.

The C230 gets supercharged power this year, good for an increase of 37 horsepower and 38 foot-pounds of torque, up to 185 and 200, respectively. The V6 that powers the C280 may not sound significant, but it produces better low-end torque than the engine it replaced while getting better fuel economy. And the V8 sitting under the hood of the C43 empowers the driver to leave just about everybody in its dust.

The C43 supersedan boasts a 4.3-liter engine that produces 302 horsepower at 5,850 rpm and 302 foot-pounds of torque between 3,250 and 5,000 rpm. Replacing the C36 sedan that turned heads from 1995 to 1997, the C43 is the latest combined effort of Mercedes-Benz and AMG, the German tuner that has modified and raced Mercedes cars for the past two decades. With this kind of power, an adaptive transmission and distinctive styling, the C43 fits well into the Mercedes tradition-yet still stands out on its own.

Other technologies that have found their way into the C-Class include side-impact airbags, the BabySmart airbag system that disables the passenger side front airbag when a Mercedes child seat is located in the front passenger seat, and Brake Assist which provides maximum braking if Mercedes has determined that you have stabbed the brake pedal in a panic situation.

The three models available this year are the C230 Kompressor, C280 and C43. Manually rowing the automatic shifter, a C230 Kompressor can now get to 60 mph in just over eight seconds, a two second improvement from last year's model. The six-cylinder C280 is quicker than the C230 Kompressor getting to speed, and getting there quickly doesn't mean changing your own gears. Handling is sure-footed with either car, and braking ability is quite good, although the C230, at 100 fewer pounds than the C280, feels somewhat more agile.

Base prices start just over $31,000 for the C230 Kompressor. The stronger C280 can be had for another four grand and includes the 2.8-liter V6, dual power front seats and an eight-speaker Bose stereo system. And then there's the steroid junkie C43, entering the market at $53 Grand. You may want to consider BMW's 328i, the Lexus ES300 or the Mazda Millenia before buying the Benz, but we can't help but think the C-Class is a relative bargain in this class, especially when considering the small car's ample luxury, spunky performance, and solid construction.

Vehicle overview
Many aspire to own a car with the three-pointed star on the hood, but few have the means. For those on the fence, the entry-level C-Class is the way to get a foot in the door. But don't let the term "entry level" fool you. Even the most basic C230 is well equipped with luxury amenities and infused with the solid engineering that is a Mercedes-Benz hallmark. Despite its age, this 7-year-old sedan still entices with ample room for four, rich wood and leather, sprightly performance and that world-renowned ornament above the grille.

Three C-Class models are available for the final year of this design cycle. The C230 Kompressor is powered by the same supercharged 2.3-liter four cylinder found in the SLK roadster. Making 185 horsepower and 200 ft-lbs. of torque, the C230 runs from zero to 60 mph in about 8 seconds. A five-speed adaptive logic automatic transmission transfers power to the rear wheels, and features Touch Shift gear selection for 2000 to appeal to fans of manual gearboxes.

Standard equipment on the C230 includes front and side airbags, traction control, stability control, ABS with Brake Assist, and a BabySmart child-seat recognition system. Leather and burled walnut wood trim are included in the base price, as are an automatic climate-control system, integrated garage door opener, power driver's seat with 10-way adjustment and heated exterior mirrors. The optional $900 sport package is worth considering, and includes sport seats, larger wheels and tires, a firmer suspension, telescoping steering wheel, and special trim.

Stepping up to the C280 nets additional goodies like a Bose audio system and power passenger's seat, but the premium paid for this pricey C primarily covers the silky-smooth 2.8-liter aluminum V6 under the hood. It doesn't make a C280 get up and go any quicker than the blown four on the C230. The benefit of C280 ownership is refinement. For those needing maximum performance and guaranteed exclusivity, Mercedes offers the AMG-massaged C43, which is discussed separately from the C230 and C280.

Handling is sure-footed with either the C230 or the C280, and braking ability is astounding in panic situations, although the C230, at 100 fewer pounds than the C280, feels somewhat more agile. Frankly, we fail to see how Mercedes justifies the premium commanded by the C280. In fact, the only complaint we can voice about the C230 is that the grumbling exhaust note doesn't impart much of a sense of luxury or prestige. But if you can get beyond that and the fact that the nomenclature on the decklid indicates to others that you bought the cheap car, a C230 Sport is the way to go.

But you've really gotta want a Benz to buy the aging C-Class. It's not a bargain, and there are less expensive ways to obtain a small luxury-brand sedan. A BMW 323i is a better deal, for example, or an Acura 3.2TL. For some, however, the lure of that three-pointed star outweighs a kidney-shaped grille topped with a blue and white roundel. You could do worse than to select the nicely appointed and eminently capable C-Class.

    Mercedes-Benz C-Class 2001($2,357 - $3,815)

<p>

Vehicle overview
Ah, to be a Mercedes owner. More specifically, to be able to tell your friends that you've just bought a Mercedes; that is the stuff of which life is made. Unfortunately, your bank account is not yet plump enough to shell out the bucks for one of the big bad muthas. And, frankly, you kind of wish that a Mercedes had a more sporting attitude.

Enter the all-new 2001 C-Class. Designed to appeal to the sport sedan crowd heretofore untapped by the three-pointed star, Mercedes offers the C-Class as a contender in the entry-level luxury sedan playing field.

Motivating the C-Class is your choice of V6s -- the 2.4-liter with 168 horsepower, or a 3.2-liter with 215 horses. And, in an effort to further compete with its venerable statesmen, a six-speed manual tranny will be available for the very first time in a C-Class, but it is reserved for the C240. Those who prefer automatic gear changes will like the tranny on the C320, a five-speeder with TouchShift. It's standard on the 320 and optional on the 240. With an improved five-link rear suspension and a new rack-and-pinion steering system, it should be as pleasurable to go canyon carving in the C-Class as it is to show up at your high school reunion.

Such luxurious features as dual climate control, steering wheel-mounted controls for and wood trim come standard on the C240. Step up to the C320 and receive a Bose stereo system, full power memory front seats and power tilt/telescoping steering wheel. Options include a stand-alone navigation system and Cockpit Management and Data System (COMAND), the center console interface that controls the navigation system, the audio system and the cell phone, xenon headlamps, heated seats, a six-disc CD changer and a sport package that provides higher spring rates, tighter shock valving, a thicker stabilizer bar and larger tires.

The jury's still out on whether or not we like the figure-eight headlamp design that reminds us of an amoeba splitting in two. But the new silhouette of the car, derivative of the S500 but with coupe-like looks, sculpted hood and triangular taillights deserves kudos.

Mercedes went all out to ensure the safety of C-Class buyers. Turn signals in the side mirrors allow others to better spot you. Standard Electronic Stability Program (ESP) that helps bring the car back in line if the system determines that the driver is losing control and four-wheel ABS (with bigger discs than previous versions to help stopping performance) assist drivers in avoiding unseemly situations. Even if you get into a collision, with dual front, four door-mounted side airbags as well as two side curtains ready to deploy, your cabin will be a veritable padded cell. Then you'll hear a concerned, helpful voice through Tele-Aid, which provides emergency services via the cell phone and GPS system.

Yes, the C-Class is the runt of the Mercedes stable. But in its own excellent clique, composed of other Teutonic and Japanese playmates, such as the 3 Series, Audi A4 or the Lexus IS 300, it could very well hold its own.

 <h3>
    Mercedes-Benz C-Class 2002($2,405 - $3,882)

 </h3>

<p>
Vehicle overview
For 2002, Mercedes covers all the bases by bringing out hatchback, wagon and high-powered sport sedan versions of the C-Class.

Starting at the low end, the $25,000 C230 Kompressor Sport Coupe (actually a hatchback) puts the three-pointed star in reach of more folks who want Mercedes safety, engineering and, yes, status.

Using the same supercharged ("kompressor" in German) 192-horsepower 2.3-liter inline four found in the SLK 230 roadster coupled to a six-speed manual gearbox, the baby Benz can sprint to 60 mph in just 7.2 seconds.

Just because this is the entry-level C doesn't mean that the standard features list is skimpy. Quite the opposite as dual-zone climate control, aluminum cabin accents, 16-inch alloy wheels, six-speaker sound system with cassette deck (though it lacks a CD player, a changer is optional), a tilt and telescopic steering wheel with stereo and trip computer controls and eight-way (manual) adjusting driver seat are all standard. Leather seating and a large "Panorama" sunroof are among the available options.

And, as expected from a Benz, the new hatch sports a boatload of high-tech safety features such as four-wheel disc brakes with ABS and Brake Assist, electronic stability control and front, side and head-protection airbags.

Moving on to the sedans, the C240 and C320 are unchanged, having just been introduced last year. The C240 is motivated by a 2.6-liter V6 with 168 horsepower (why it's not called the C260 escapes us) and the C320 sports a 3.2-liter V6 with 215 horses. And, in an effort to further compete with its venerable statesmen (i.e. BMW), a six-speed manual gearbox can be had in the C240. Those who prefer automatic gear changes will like the responsive tranny in the C320, a five-speeder with Mercedes' TouchShift feature that allows manual gearchanging should the mood strike. It's standard on the 320 and optional on the 240. With a five-link rear suspension and a rack-and-pinion steering system, the C-Class demonstrates ability at canyon carving that the pre-2001 car lacked.

Such luxury features as dual climate control, steering wheel-mounted controls and wood trim come standard on the C240. Step up to the C320 and receive a Bose stereo system, full power memory front seats and power tilt/telescoping steering wheel. Options include a stand-alone navigation system and Mercedes' Cockpit Management and Data System (COMAND) -- the center console interface that controls the navigation system, the audio system and the cell phone -- xenon headlamps, heated seats, a six-disc CD changer and a sport package that provides higher spring rates, tighter shock valving, a thicker stabilizer bar and larger tires.

Wundertuner AMG applies their magic to the C-class sedan and the result is the pavement-scorching C32 AMG. No less than 349 horsepower pour out of the C32's supercharged V6, hooked up to an enhanced five-speed automatic dubbed "SpeedShift" that together vault the car to 60 mph in around 5 seconds flat. Beefy vented disc brakes, an AMG-massaged suspension and 17-inch alloys wearing fat performance rubber complete the hardware package. A front air dam and side skirts, unique wheels and a two-tone interior separate the C32 from the garden-variety C-class sedans.

Also added to the C-class family for 2002 is the C320 Sport Wagon. Essentially the same as a C320 sedan under the skin, it shares that model's features and provides up to 63.6 cubic feet of cargo capacity. And the wagon hauls more than spoils from a day of antiquing; its zero-to-60 mph time of 7.0 seconds (according to Mercedes) is just a tick slower than the C320 sedan.

Both C300 trims' standard equipment includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a sunroof, eight-way power front seats, a tilt-telescoping steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, MB-Tex cloth upholstery, the COMAND control interface with a pop-up display screen, Bluetooth connectivity and an audio system with single-CD player and an auxiliary audio jack. The C300 4Matic Luxury and C300 4Matic Sport models have the same features but add all-wheel drive.

The C350 Sport is essentially a C300 Sport with the Premium I Package and black bird's eye maple wood interior trim, while the C63 AMG comes with all the standard features of the C350 Sport and adds a firmer suspension, bigger brakes, 18-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, special AMG exterior and interior styling cues, unique AMG seats with aggressive side bolsters, split-folding rear seats and aluminum shift paddles.

All C300s can be equipped with the Premium I Package that adds rain-sensing wipers, auto-dimming mirrors, heated front seats, satellite radio and driver side memory with power steering column and tilt-down reverse passenger mirror. Optional on all C-Class trim levels is the Premium II Package that adds LED taillamps, corner-illuminating foglights, split-folding rear seats (except for the C63 AMG, since these come standard), a power rear window sunshade and bi-xenon headlamps. The Multimedia Package includes a hard-drive-based navigation system, voice controls and a premium Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system that adds an in-dash six-CD changer.

For the C63 AMG, an optional AMG Seating Package adds premium leather upholstery, driver and passenger memory seats and a four-way power-adjustable steering column. The AMG Performance Package adds a limited-slip rear differential, a compound braking system with cross-drilled rotors, a more aggressively tuned suspension and an increased top speed of 174 mph.

Stand-alone options include leather upholstery, a panorama sunroof, TeleAid satellite communications, 18-inch wheels, an iPod integration kit and the in-dash CD changer

   <h3>
Mercedes-Benz C-Class 2017($24,499 - $61,990)

   </h3> 



<p>
Mercedes-Benz offers the 2017 C-Class in three body styles: sedan, coupe and convertible (Cabriolet). But you'll need to pay attention as Mercedes-Benz's handling of options, packages and trims can be a bit arcane.

The C-Class sedan, coupe and convertible are available in five flavors. The base C300 trim comes with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and the C300 4Matic adds all-wheel drive. From there, three AMG models are available: the new AMG C43 with its twin-turbo V6, and the AMG C63 and AMG C63 S, which use slightly different versions of a twin-turbo V8. A plug-in hybrid version, the C350e, will also be available later in the model year.

The C300 sedan is available with two subtrims, Sport or Luxury. These offer slightly different suspension, wheel design and styling details for a minimal cost. Fans of the stand-up Mercedes-Benz hood star will want to opt for the Luxury package.

Standard equipment highlights include 17-inch wheels, automatic wipers, a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power-adjustable steering wheel, 10-way power front seats (with four-way lumbar), driver-seat memory settings, synthetic leather upholstery (the rather good MB-Tex), 40/20/40-split folding rear seatbacks, the COMAND infotainment system (with a 7-inch central display screen and a console-mounted dial controller), Bluetooth and an audio system with a CD player, dual USB ports, an SD card reader and HD radio.

Opting for the C300 coupe means that 18-inch wheels and the panoramic sunroof come as standard equipment, but the rearview camera becomes an optional extra. Convertible models get the camera standard, along with a power-folding fabric top, Mercedes' Airscarf system — which delivers warmed air to the neck and shoulders of front passengers — a removable wind blocker, and a blind-spot monitor.

Primary options packages differ slightly between the four-door and two-door versions of the C300. The Premium 1 package adds blind-spot monitoring, keyless entry and push-button start, and satellite radio. In the coupe and convertible, the Premium 1 package also includes the upgraded Burmester sound system.

In the sedan, the Premium 2 package includes the Premium 1 upgrades and adds LED headlamps and the premium sound system. The Premium 3 package really starts loading in the tech, with an electronic trunk closer, voice controls, ambient interior lighting, an upgraded 8.4-inch screen with navigation, and a touchpad infotainment controller. Premium 4 adds a host of active safety and collision mitigation and avoidance features, as well as adaptive cruise control, a cabin air purification and fragrance system, and cornering headlamps with automatic high beams.
Adding these packages also requires opting for either heated and ventilated, or just heated, front seats.

For the coupe and cabriolet, the Premium 2 and Premium 3 packages are the equivalent of the sedan's Premium 3 and Premium 4 packages. There is no Premium 4 package for the two-door models. The Airmatic package adds an air suspension with multiple suspension tuning modes.

Standalone options for the C300 include a panoramic sunroof, a head-up display, heated and ventilated seats, a heated steering wheel and a number of interior and exterior trim pieces.

AMG C43 models get the Premium 1 package (as that applies to the two- and four-door models) standard, along with slightly different interior trim that includes natural grain, black wood trim on the sedan, and gloss black trim in the coupe and cabriolet. The AMG C63 and C63 S sedan also get the Premium 2 package standard. Sport seats, red seat belts and a special AMG head-up display are available for the AMG models' interior, while — for the two-door models — optional carbon-ceramic brakes, exhaust and upgraded wheels and tires can be had to up the sporting credentials.

Powering the 2017 Mercedes-Benz C300 is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. A seven-speed automatic is the only available transmission, and sends power to the rear wheels. Opting for the 4Matic system gets you all-wheel drive.

Mercedes estimates the C300 sedan and coupe will reach 60 mph in 6.3 seconds. The EPA estimates fuel economy at <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=37461">26 mpg combined</a> (23 city/30 highway) for the rear-wheel drive and<a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=37428">25 mpg combine</a> d (23 city/29 highway) for the 4Matic.

The AMG C43 receives a turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 that produces 362 hp and 384 lb-ft of torque. A new nine-speed automatic transmission is standard, and Mercedes estimates the AMG C43 will reach 60 mph in 4.6 seconds.

Meanwhile, the AMG C63 shoehorns in a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 that thumps out an impressive 469 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque, and the C63 S increases output to 503 hp and 516 lb-ft. Both have a seven-speed automatic. Estimates put them at 60 mph in 4.0 and 3.9 seconds, respectively, and both receive a multiclutch, high-performance seven-speed automatic transmission. Zero-to-sixty times for the convertible models are uniformly a tenth of a second slo

The C300 sedan (and C300 4Matic) comes standard with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (241 horsepower, 273 pound-feet of torque), a nine-speed automatic transmission, 17-inch wheels, automatic wipers, a rearview camera, a sunroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, 10-way power front seats (with four-way lumbar adjustment), driver-seat memory settings, simulated leather upholstery (the rather good MB-Tex) and 40/20/40-split folding rear seatbacks.

In the coupe and convertible, the Premium package also includes an upgraded Burmester sound system.

Several other options packages are available for the C300 and C350e as well as stand-alone options. We'll dispense with the packages first.
