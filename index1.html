    <p> The 2015 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a large, five-passenger SUV that is offered in two trims: G550 and G 63 AMG.

     In addition to that, other standard items include dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, 10-way power front seats (with adjustable side bolsters, shoulder supports and six-way lumbar), driver memory functions, heated front and rear outboard seats, ventilated front seats and a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel.

     Upgrading to the G 63 gets you a more powerful turbocharged engine as well as 20-inch wheels, AMG-specific styling elements, upgraded "designo" leather upholstery (optional on G550) and an automatic stop-start function for fuel economy.

    <h3> g-class 2016 ($79,700 - $86,990)</h3>
    <p> The 2016 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a five-passenger SUV that is offered in three trims: G550, AMG G 63 and AMG G 65.

  Standard features on the G550 include 19-inch alloy wheels, dual side-mounted exhaust outlets, bi-xenon headlights, LED running lights, heated power-folding mirrors, a sunroof, automatic wipers, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control and a blind-spot monitoring system. Offered exclusively on the G550 is an optional electronically adjustable suspension with two modes (Comfort and Sport).

  The G550's cabin comes standard with dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated 10-way power front seats (with adjustable side bolsters, shoulder supports and six-way lumbar), driver memory settings, heated rear outboard seats, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, two 12-volt power ports (one for each seating row) and a 115-volt household-style outlet in the cargo area. Also included are the COMAND electronics interface with a 7-inch display, a navigation system, voice commands, traffic reporting, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity and a 12-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound system with CD and DVD player, a USB audio input, an auxiliary audio jack, HD radio, satellite radio and an SD card reader.

  Upgrading to the G 63 gets you a more powerful turbocharged V8 as well as 20-inch wheels, performance brakes, an AMG-tuned suspension, sport exhaust, AMG-specific styling elements, upgraded leather upholstery (optional on G550) and interior trim, a sport steering wheel and an automatic stop-start function — ostensibly to improve fuel economy, which remains abysmal, of course.

  Moving up to G 65 brings a turbocharged V12 engine but not much else, especially given this trim's jaw-dropping price premium. Additional perks include unique styling flourishes, 21-inch wheels (20s become optional) and diamond-stitched seat and door upholstery.

  G-Class options are few and include a stainless-steel brush guard, different wheel styles, carbon-fiber or premium wood interior trim, a heated steering wheel, a synthetic-suede headliner and a rear-seat entertainment system.  </p>

    <h3>g-class 2017 ($79,220 - $86,954)
</h3>
    <p>The 2017 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a five-passenger SUV that is offered in four trim levels: G550, AMG G63, AMG G65 and G550 4x42 (as in "squared"). All versions are equipped with a seven-speed automatic transmission, live axles at both ends, full-time four-wheel drive, a two-speed transfer case and three locking differentials, and they can tow up to 7,000 pounds. The G550 is entry-level only in a relative sense. It's extremely well-equipped — beyond its prodigious drivetrain hardware, it has leather-upholstered 10-way power-adjustable and heated seats, heated backseats, power-folding and heated mirrors, adaptive cruise, dual-zone climate control, navigation and premium audio. It's equipped with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 (416 horsepower, 450 pound-feet of torque).

Stepping up to the AMG G63 nets you a 5.5-liter twin-turbo V8 (563 hp, 561 lb-ft of torque), 20-inch wheels, larger brakes and a performance-tuned suspension. It also grants access to the AMG Performance Studio, whereby near-endless customization is available. The next step in the G-Class lineup goes from merely silly to truly absurd: the AMG G65, which slots in a twin-turbo 6.0-liter V12 (621 hp, 738 lb-ft of torque) and adds 21-inch wheels and revised upholstery.

Then there's the G550 4x42, for which words do not do justice. This has the 4.0-liter V8 but swaps the standard axles for portal axles, which dramatically increase ground clearance. It also adds 22-inch wheels, larger-diameter tires, twin coilover-damper assemblies at each wheel, wider fender flares and skid plates. </p>

    <h3>g-class 2019 ($183,857)</h3>
   <p>The 2019 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a five-seat SUV that's available in two versions. The G 550 is the well-equipped standard model and comes with a powerful engine, luxurious interior and excellent off-road capability. The AMG G 63 features a more powerful engine and a powertrain tuned for on-road performance. It also differentiates itself from the standard model with a distinctive grille, wheels, fender flares and side-exit exhaust system.

The Mercedes-Benz G 550 is powered by a turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 engine and produces 416 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque. A nine-speed automatic transmission sends the engine power to all four wheels. And as is customary for the G-Class, a complete set of lockable differentials (front, center and rear) can be actuated as needed by the driver to control wheelspin on tough terrain.

Since the G-Class is a luxury SUV, it comes standard with a broad range of creature comforts such as 19-inch wheels, three-zone climate control, leather seats, driver-seat memory functions, heated front seats, and a Burmester surround-sound system.

Driver assist and safety equipment includes active lane centering, front collision mitigation, and Pre-Safe, which configures the cabin to minimize a collision's impact on passengers.

Power-hungry SUV drivers will find satisfaction with the AMG G 63. Although the G 63 comes with a 4.0-liter turbocharged engine just like the G 550, the engineers at AMG juiced it up to produce 577 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque. It also has a revised nine-speed transmission that serves up quicker shifts and adaptive suspension damping for better chassis control.

Features and technology carry over from the G 550, but the AMG G 63 comes with an aggressive look thanks to different wheels, grille, wheel arches and side-exit exhaust.

Notable options for the G-Class include the Seat Comfort package (multicontour front seats with ventilation and massage), the Exclusive Interior package (upgraded interior upholstery and trim) and an upgraded digital gauge cluster display. </p>

    <h3>g-class 2021 ($131,750 - $156,450 )</h3>
   <p>
    Some G-Class customers think there is no substitute for the AMG G 63, but our pick is the G 550. It delivers the bold style and legendary capability for which the G-Class is known and gives you plenty of opportunity to customize its exterior appearance and interior materials.

    Mercedes offers the 2021 G-Class in standard G 550 and performance-tuned AMG G 63 specification. Each is well equipped right out of the box. Feature highlights include:
